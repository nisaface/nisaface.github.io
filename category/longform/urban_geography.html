<p><b>Course Description:</b><br>
This course will serve as a geographical introduction to the history, theory, form, and function of cities. In the past decade, the number of people living in cities has surpassed the world’s rural population. Demographers speculate that cities will account for all global population growth over the next fifty years as people continue to leave rural areas for urbanized life.</p>
<p>Our global future, in other words, is an urban future.</p>
<p>Rather than occurring primarily in cities like New York and Paris, most urban changes are happening in the developing world, in places like Lagos, Mumbai, and São Paolo. As sites of economic production, spaces of cultural and artistic expression, and places where inequality is often rendered most visible, cities pose new challenges and offer opportunities for governments, communities and individuals the world over. Our class will employ a number of different vantage points and disciplinary lenses in order to interrogate these exciting and complex urban landscapes.</p>
<p> Over the course of the semester, we'll explore a number of cities and themes, mapped out below:</p>

<h1>Schedule of Topics<br></h1>
<h2>Week 1: Introductions: Why Cities</h2>
<p>After introductions and a run-through of the syllabus, for our first meeting we will discuss what kinds of ideas about and experiences of cities we all bring to the classroom. Our learning in this class will require a commitment from all of us to open and active discussion and productive critique, and I hope to set the groundwork for this early by having a broad conversation about some basic questions: What are cities? Who are they for? What work do they accomplish?

<h2>Week 2: Emergence of Cities, Empire, Colonialism</h2>
<p>The aim of this week’s class will be twofold. First, we will begin to develop an introductory language that we can use to talk and write about cities. We’ll continue to work on this all semester, but today is Second, we will spend most of class discussion exploring the historical emergence of cities, and we will try to highlight the points of connection and divergence between ancient cities and our contemporary urban world. A key aspect of our discussions here will focus on the relationships between cities and the empires that they are interwoven with—from the Roman Empire to the apex of (primarily) European colonialism: How are cities connected to these broader geographies of power and control? What can cities teach us about the uneven nature of development?
</p><br>
<h2>Week 3: Industrial Capitalism, Modernity</h2>
<p>The growth of empires is always tied to systems of economic exchange. What happens in and to cities when those systems change? Once again our meeting will address two themes, this time concentrating on those that can be mapped onto European cities of the late 18th and 19th century cities. First, we will look at how the transition from mercantilism to industrial capitalism transformed urban space and life in cities in myriad ways. Then, we will focus on the ways that these economic changes were also cultural changes, and we will explore the idea of modernity and emergence of a certain notion of urban planning and urban order.
</p><br>
<h2>Week 4: Race, Segregation, Suburbs</h2>
<p>For the next few weeks, we will turn our attention primarily to American cities of the 20th century. A key facet of the (uneven) development of these cities has been the ways in which urban space has been ordered and organized by those in power. This week we will turn our focus to the relationships between urban governance, cultures and economies of white supremacy, and neighborhood change. As is evident in recent news from cities across the country—from Ferguson to Chicago to Baltimore—the effects of urban segregation and suburbanization continue to have dramatic impacts on life in American cities.
</p><br>
<h2>Week 5: Gentrification, Displacement, Eviction</h2>
<p>This week we examine neighborhood change, and the effects of class differences and uneven economic development on families and communities. We’ll spend most of the class looking at gentrification (one of the buzziest of urban buzzwords) and a related-yet-distinct processes of eviction and displacement. When neighborhoods gentrify, where do the people who can no longer afford to stay in their neighborhoods go? What is the process of eviction like and how does it impact families and communities?
</p><br>
<h2>Week 6: Class Trip to NYC</h2>
<p>We will meet in the morning at Penn Station in Manhattan and begin a day of exploration and analysis in NYC. The trip will include a meeting with housing rights activists, some discussion of gentrification and neighborhood change, and general exploration of things like urban infrastructure, surveillance, urban environments and sustainability, and some good old-fashioned NYC history.  The readings for this week are classics, and they will be incredibly useful touchpoints for discussion and debate as we make our way around New York.</p><br>
<h2>Week 7: Neoliberalism, Foreclosure, Housing Crisis</h2>
<p>We return this week to a focus on broad economic changes and their impacts on cities. Our attention will be on the emergence of what’s known as the neoliberal political economy. Beginning in the 1970s and 80s, major transformations in global commerce and logistics meant that the industrial cities of the West that dominated the global economy would be increasingly challenged by development in the cities of the global South. Neoliberalism also brought about powerful challenges to the institutions and mechanisms of the welfare state, the emergence of austerity politics, and the rise of the dominance of the financial sector. These (and other) transformations would ultimately set the stage for the emergence of sub-prime lending, high foreclosure rates, and ultimately the financial crisis of 2008.
</p><br>
<h2>Week 8: Policing, Violence, Mass Incarceration</h2>
<h2>Week 9: Urbicide, Global War, Military Urbanism</h2>
<h2>Week 10: Migration, Borders, Megacities</h2>
<h2>Week 11: Margins, Enclaves, Slums</h2>
<h2>Week 12: Infrastructure, Logistics, Waste</h2>
<h2>Week 13: Thanksgiving Break</h2>
<h2>Week 14: Climate Change, Sustainability, Environmental Justice</h2>
<h2>Week 15: Public Space, Protest, and the Right to the City</h2>
