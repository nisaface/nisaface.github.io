      I can't remember how it was that I ended up picking up <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2002-fossil-capital">this</a> book, but it quickly became one that I couldn't put down. Malm's text is comprehensive and thorough, but (for me at least) what is most rewarding about the book is that it offers a pretty substantial re-imagining of a history that I thought I knew, and it does so by focusing on transformations in the spaces of production.<br><br><br><br>

      <div class="post-content">
      I came across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Cotton-History-Sven-Beckert/dp/0375414142">this</a> book over the winter when looking for readings to assign for my <a href="http://crisisofenclosure.com/economics-and-society"><i>Economics and Society</i></a> class. I finally got around to reading it and it is fantastic. I might even use it as a base text to structure the whole class next spring. With each iteration that class is becoming more and more of a heterodox economics/history of capitalism class than a straight-up econ class. I think it's a whole lot more interesting that way, and this book helps to demonstrate many of the reasons why it's also more relevant that way too.<br><br><br>

      I picked <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1869-the-beach-beneath-the-street">this</a> up on a whim when <i>Verso</i> had one of its ridiculous sales on ebooks. I can't stress how important the Situationists were to me when I was in architecture school. I devised and designed my thesis project with both Debord and Constant on my mind. But since then, I've largely left their emancipatory visions behind. Recently, however, I've been thinking about a new design project, and it's nice to have a fresh take on the people and ideas that so influenced me almost twenty (<i>Gulp!</i>) years ago.<br><br>

      <div class="post-content">
      I just started reading <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1901-the-happiness-industry">this</a> on the train yesterday. It's the second book in a row by a William, and the second in a row that is both entertaining and deeply unsettling. So far, it's like an economic sociologist's research monograph written in the style of a Seinfeld episode. That's not to say it's a book about nothing. Far from it. Rather, as I read it I find I'm laughing, or at least shaking my head at the absurdity of it all, but it generates a great deal of dis-ease and anxiety for me at the same time.<br><br>

      Gibson's dark narrative of an encounter between the worlds of two different time periods is as entertaining as it is unsettling. Reading it I moved between fascination with the worlds that Gibson created and a deep discomfort with how totally plausible many of the book's darker scenes were. It was the perfect book to start the summer with.<br><br><br><br><br>
