      <div class="post-content">
      I picked <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1869-the-beach-beneath-the-street">this</a> up on a whim when <i>Verso</i> had one of its ridiculous sales on ebooks. I can't stress how important the Situationists were to me when I was in architecture school. I devised and designed my thesis project with both Debord and Constant on my mind. But since then, I've largely left their emancipatory visions behind. Recently, however, I've been thinking about a new design project, and it's nice to have a fresh take on the people and ideas that so influenced me almost twenty (<i>Gulp!</i>) years ago.<br><br>

      I just started reading <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1901-the-happiness-industry">this</a> on the train yesterday. It's the second book in a row by a William, and the second in a row that is both entertaining and deeply unsettling. So far, it's like an economic sociologist's research monograph written in the style of a Seinfeld episode. That's not to say it's a book about nothing. Far from it. Rather, as I read it I find I'm laughing, or at least shaking my head at the absurdity of it all, but it generates a great deal of dis-ease and anxiety for me at the same time.<br><br>

      Gibson's dark narrative of an encounter between the worlds of two different time periods is as entertaining as it is unsettling. Reading it I moved between fascination with the worlds that Gibson created and a deep discomfort with how totally plausible many of the book's darker scenes were. It was the perfect book to start the summer with.<br><br><br><br><br>
